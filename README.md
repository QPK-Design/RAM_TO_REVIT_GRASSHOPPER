# RAM TO REVIT GRASSHOPPER

This code would not exist if not for Marcello Sgambelluri's excellent talk on using the RAM API in Dynamo, which can be viewed on Autodesk University here: https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Intro-Getting-Dynamo-talk-RAM-Structure-Using-API-2019 and his code for accessing RAM Sructural Systems model information within Dynamo for Revit.

The goal of this project is to provide data from a RAM Structural model to be used within Grasshopper as an intermediate step toward identifying differences in an architectural design model in Autodesk Revit.
